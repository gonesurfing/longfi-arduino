### Example decoders that one can add as Functions within the Helium Console

- CubeCell-Decoder.js: Helium Console decoder for use with the Helium Mapping/Cargo efforts
- Decoder-for-datacake.js: This decoder can be used to decode the Cubecell payload to be able to use it as a tracking device to track position on a mobile phone or tablet using the DataCake cloud platform
- Google-Sheets-Post-Script.gs: This decoder allows google sheets to be used as an integration for Cubecell tracker. This will enable recording the gps coordinates sent by the Cubecell device, the coordinates of the hotspot that received the message, and the distance from the Cubecell tracker to the witnessing hotspot
